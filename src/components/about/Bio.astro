            Whether advising founders or partnering with executive leaders, I bridge vision and
            execution—helping organizations build stronger cultures and deliver meaningful,
            user-driven results.

            I live in Italy with my wife and two daughters, where we spend weekends exploring
            surrounding towns, discovering local traditions, tending our citrus trees and olive
            orchard, and making the most of slow living.
