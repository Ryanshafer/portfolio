  description: "Three key lessons from a decade of building design systems at MTV, Showmax, and Oritain—focusing on shared language, production-ready components, and scalable UX strategies that accelerated product delivery across teams and platforms."
summary:
  role: "UX Lead & Design System Strategist"
  problem: "Across different companies, design and engineering teams lacked shared systems, leading to inconsistency, rework, and slow delivery."
  insight: "A design system only succeeds when it reflects a shared language between design and engineering — and is implemented in production code."
  approach: |-
    Over more than a decade, I led foundational design system efforts in three very different contexts:
    - **MTV** — Pioneering one of the first responsive, code-based design systems within a major media organization.
    - **Showmax** — Bridging the gap between agency-created visuals and product-ready components.
    - **Oritain** — Extending marketing language into a systematic framework while confronting the risks of a system that lives only in Figma.
  impact: |-
    Accelerated time-to-market, improved product consistency, and enabled teams to focus on high-value features. At MTV, the system helped drive a **565% increase in visits** and a **297% increase in time spent**.

## Overview

> A design system only drives real impact when it’s built on a shared language and lives in code.

Long before design systems became an industry standard, I was building them out of necessity—applying a systems mindset across media, B2C, and B2B contexts to solve a range of organizational challenges. The three lessons below reflect how those experiences shaped my approach, project by project.


## Lesson 1: MTV — Design in Code

### A system isn’t real until it lives in production.

**Problem:** Designers and developers worked in silos, leading to inconsistent UIs and slower product rollouts.

**Approach:** Partnered with the VP of Technology to pair a product designer and front-end engineer. Together, they:
  * Standardized HTML and class naming
  * Built reusable components
  * Enabled multi-brand token-based theming across MTV, VH1, CMT, and Logo.

**Impact:** Launched MTV’s first design system rooted in production code—accelerating delivery and contributing to a 565% increase in visits and a 297% increase in time spent.

## Lesson 2: Showmax — Build a Shared Language

### Systems thrive when design and engineering speak the same language.

**Problem:** The agency delivered the design system in static files, and without a full understanding of it, engineers translated components into code—resulting in drift, inefficiencies, and inconsistent user experiences.

**Approach:**
  * Led cross-functional workshops across Design, Web, TV, and App product and engineering teams.
  * Aligned tokens, patterns, and components
  * Established shared governance by assigning system ownership to both designers and developers

**Impact:** Established a shared language through a unified component library—strengthening cross-team communication, increasing efficiency, and enabling faster, more consistent delivery across platforms.

## Lesson 3: Oritain — Delaying Systems Comes at a Cost

### Investing in design systems is strategic infrastructure — not an optional extra.

**Problem:** High design maturity but limited front-end engineering capacity meant design system software development was repeatedly deprioritized in favor of short-term delivery.

**Approach:**
  * Defined a comprehensive Figma-based system (tokens, colors, components)
  * Championed investment in design system development by securing roadmap focus and engineering support—pushing leads to advocate for its importance and allocate resources
  * Promoted frameworks like Tailwind, Storybook, and UI libraries to support scalable, component-based development
  * Coached developers on component-based thinking, a common design language and Dev Mode workflows

**Impact:** Delivered a scalable design framework that ensured brand cohesion and team alignment. However, repeated deprioritization of implementation slowed iteration and limited impact—underscoring Lesson 1: a system isn’t real until it lives in code.
    

## Reflection
---

Across MTV, Showmax, and Oritain, I learned three enduring lessons about building effective design systems:

* **Design in code** — A system isn’t real until it lives in production.
* **Build a shared language** — Systems thrive when design and engineering speak the same language.
* **Treat design systems as strategy** — Delaying them slows iteration and limits impact.

These principles now guide how I scale design practice—embedding systems into product strategy as core infrastructure for speed, quality, and alignment across teams.
