  description: A UX/UI case study showing how research-driven design transformed a fragmented global supplier testing process into a scalable digital platform—through modular UI systems, accessibility for multilingual users, Stripe and DocuSign integration, and iterative testing.
summary:
  role: "UX Lead / UI Designer"
  timeline: "3 weeks research & mapping → 3 months design iterations → ~1 month testing with refinements"
  problem: "Oritain’s supplier testing process was manual and error-prone—limiting data quality, scalability, and revenue. The challenge: design a digital flow that translated a complex, multi-step process into a clear, guided UI that suppliers around the world could trust and use with confidence."
  insight: "Complex service flows can become scalable UI systems through plain language, step-by-step guidance, and modular design—supporting non-native English speakers and reducing errors."
  approach: "I mapped the manual workflow with service teams, prototyped modular UI patterns in Figma, and extended our design system. I used AI tools to simplify language for basic English comprehension and ran remote usability tests with suppliers worldwide. Throughout, I navigated major design pivots—like payment model changes—balancing MVP delivery with long-term design principles."
  impact: "Achieved 100% task completion in testing, dramatically reduced data entry errors and duplicates, and unlocked a scalable new revenue stream—helping secure one of Oritain’s largest client contracts to date."

## Problem Context & Key Challenges
--------

Oritain, a global leader in supply chain verification, faced a critical challenge: **its supplier testing process was manual, slow, and prone to error**. Clients paid the cost, while suppliers worldwide navigated a complex, multi-step workflow—often across regions, time zones, and languages.

The opportunity was to empower suppliers to manage testing directly, reducing client oversight, improving data quality, and unlocking a scalable new revenue stream.

### Key challenges included:
- **A multi-step, high-stakes workflow** requiring precise data entry to avoid costly errors and wasted tests.
- **A global, multilingual user base** with many suppliers using English at a basic proficiency level.
- **Manual, error-prone operations** relying on spreadsheets, emails, and copy-pasting, leading to frequent data errors and duplicates.
- **Evolving requirements and shifting priorities**, including mid-project pivots like payment model changes, demanding flexible design strategies.
- **A complex, un-systematized manual process** that needed to be translated into a scalable digital flow.

## Research & Service Mapping (~3 weeks research & mapping)
--------

### Mapped Manual Workflow
I interviewed service delivery staff across the organization to understand the day-to-day testing process and map the manual workflow. Like many startups, Oritain had evolved through quick, manual fixes to meet growing client needs. As a result, no two service flows were exactly alike, and requirements kept shifting as I dug deeper.

**This reinforced the need for a flexible UX strategy: build just enough structure to move forward while staying ready to adapt.**

## Design Principles & Strategic Approach
--------

### To succeed, the UI needed to:
- **Leverage research-backed personas and model key concepts** (contracts, facilities, tests) as interactive, modular objects for clarity and reusability.
- **Minimize cognitive load** through a guided, step-by-step flow using plain, accessible language simplified with AI tools to support non-native English speakers.
- **Reflect Oritain’s manual process** to maintain testing accuracy and internal alignment.
- **Prioritize tablets and desktops**—the primary devices used by global suppliers.
- **Prevent costly errors** by designing for data accuracy and clarity.
- **Stay modular and scalable** for future adaptation and client-facing use cases.
- **Avoid building everything in-house** by integrating Stripe for payments and DocuSign for contracts—saving time, ensuring compliance, and improving user trust through familiar tools.

## From Manual Workflow to Modular UI System (3 months designing and iterating)
--------
### Designing a Digital Workflow

I sketched low-fidelity UI flows to translate the manual workflow into a clear, guided digital experience that preserved critical details while improving usability. These flows aligned stakeholders across Service Delivery, Product, and Engineering around a shared vision.

<ImageWithStyle src="/assets/studies/ui-design-complex-workflows/content/oritain-digital-flow.png" alt="The digital flow preserved core steps but streamlined responsibilities between suppliers and Oritain." />

I then iterated in Figma—using and extending Oritain’s design system—to prototype the full end-to-end supplier experience. These prototypes helped define technical requirements and served as the foundation for moderated remote usability testing with suppliers worldwide.

### Major Design Pivots
- **Payment model:** I recommended a familiar cart/checkout flow to minimize friction and support future scenarios, but leadership opted for a bundled credit model mirroring client sales. This increased cognitive load, introduced complex UI states, and required midstream redesigns.

<ImageWithStyle src="/assets/studies/ui-design-complex-workflows/content/oritain-payment.png" alt="Instead of building everything from scratch, we used Stripe for payments and DocuSign for contract signing." />


- **Late technical discoveries:** Requirements like handling complex material composition data emerged deep into the build. I designed lightweight but robust UI patterns to capture nuanced inputs and prevent data errors without derailing MVP timelines.

### System & Accessibility Considerations

- **Used AI-assisted UX writing to ensure clear, low-reading-level text**, prioritized error prevention and clarity to avoid costly wasted tests and maintain supplier trust.
- Designed for fluid layouts and touch support on tablets and desktops, reflecting suppliers’ typical factory-floor shared devices rather than phones.

## Validating the Design Through Usability Testing (~1 Month Across Two Phases)
--------

In **Phase 1**, early Figma prototypes tested core flows and object models. **Completion rates hovered around 70%**, with failures pointing to usability gaps in effort and clarity. Fixes were clear and actionable.

In **Phase 2**, refined pre-launch software addressed major blockers and improved language. **Task completion rose to 100%**, confirming the effectiveness of design decisions.

<ImageWithStyle src="/assets/studies/ui-design-complex-workflows/content/oritain-user-testing.png" alt="During usability testing, some users had trouble completing tasks because instructions were unclear or important information was missing." />

Throughout both testing phases, I resolved language and navigation issues, adapted UI flows in response to evolving requirements, and balanced those changes against MVP constraints to preserve scalability. Along the way, I also uncovered opportunities for future features.

## Impact
--------

The redesigned supplier portal delivered significant benefits:

- **100% task completion** in usability tests with the pre-launch build.
- **Reduced Errors:** Significantly minimized data entry mistakes and duplicate records through guided input and validation.
- **Scalability:** The modular design system supports ongoing feature/flow expansion.
- **Revenue Growth:** The portal enabled Oritain to open a new scalable revenue stream.
- **Business Success:** Played a key role in securing one of Oritain’s largest client contracts to date.
- **Improved User Confidence:** Suppliers reported higher satisfaction and ease of use.

## Reflection
--------

**This project reinforced the power of strong design principles as an anchor in complex, high-stakes UI work.** The supplier portal demanded translating a nuanced, multilingual service flow into a clear, step-by-step digital experience—while navigating shifting business priorities.

When decisions like the payment model diverged from ideal UX patterns, I relied on core principles—clarity, error prevention, modularity—to keep the product cohesive and usable.

It also marked my first use of AI-assisted UX writing at scale, which proved essential for ensuring clarity without localization—a critical factor for non-native English speakers across global supply chains.

More than anything, this work sharpened my ability to balance ideal solutions with real-world constraints. It taught me when to push, when to adapt, and how to protect the user experience either way. That balance — between principled design and pragmatic delivery — is what I bring to every complex UI initiative I lead.
