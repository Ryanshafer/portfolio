## Project Overview
---

As the sole UX lead at a fast-growing traceability startup, I was tasked with designing and delivering Oritain’s first enterprise client platform. Previously, clients relied on static reports, manual touchpoints, and fragmented tools to access their testing data—resulting in delayed insights and inconsistent user experience.

The project was shaped by high-stakes constraints: tight legal deadlines, an evolving product model, and limited design resources. Over two years, I collaborated closely with Product, Engineering, Sales, and Executive teams to define user needs, design and deliver an MVP, and scale the platform into new capabilities.

In the final phase of my engagement, I began prototyping AI-powered tools to help clients better interpret their data and testing programs—positioning the platform for future growth and premium offerings.

## My Role
---
I served as Consulting UX Lead, responsible for end-to-end product design strategy. This included user research, information architecture, interaction design, prototyping, stakeholder alignment, and design system development. As demand grew, I hired and mentored a second UX designer, scaling the function while embedding a collaborative, user-first culture.

## Building the Foundation
---

Early in the project, I facilitated discovery workshops with stakeholders across Sales, Ops, Tech, and Product to align on objectives. I followed this with generative user research focused on fashion industry clients using cotton traceability. These conversations revealed gaps in client understanding, reporting consistency, and the timing of critical decision points.

To gain strategic alignment, I shared synthesized insights through an internal roadshow. This helped unify the company’s understanding of user needs and set the foundation for a scalable product experience that could serve clients, suppliers, and internal teams alike. The CEO found this particularly valuable and asked me to create a condensed version of the roadshow that he could use to build awareness and alignment in executive conversations across the company.

## Concepting and MVP Development
---

With insights in hand, I created key user personas and mapped scenarios to define the platform’s architecture and data flows. I then designed and tested interactive prototypes, iterating based on usability feedback.

I presented the product vision and roadmap directly to the board—alongside the CEO, Chief Strategy Officer, and CFO—securing buy-in and reinforcing UX as a strategic driver. Although I had planned to co-present with my Product partner, I led the session independently due to their unexpected absence.

During implementation, I worked closely with Engineering to clarify scope, adapt designs as new edge cases emerged, and support quality assurance. The MVP launched with zero disruption to client contracts—delivering on all core commitments.

## Platform Expansion
---

Following launch, we expanded the platform’s capabilities to serve internal and vendor-facing workflows. To design a vendor self-service portal, I first mapped internal service delivery processes and uncovered friction points. These insights informed new tools for digitizing contract management and integrating payment features.

In parallel, I mentored our second UX designer through the delivery of new insights features. We validated early concepts through low-code prototypes, including a “Wizard of Oz” simulation using Power BI-generated PDFs. This allowed us to test how clients interpreted results before investing in full-scale development—de-risking the process while preserving agility.

One of the most impactful changes came with the shift from manual to live data reporting. Previously, internal teams had to manually review and compile results before sharing with clients—often introducing days of lag. After launching real-time data publishing and report notifications, results were available the moment a lab tech submitted them. While not formally tracked, this shift significantly reduced turnaround time and likely improved internal team efficiency as well.

## Strategic AI Exploration
---

As the platform matured, I began exploring how LLM-based tools could scale data interpretation. Both clients and Oritain’s internal experts invested significant time analyzing results—whether to understand testing outcomes or determine next steps. These processes were time-intensive, difficult to scale, and sometimes introduced compliance risk.

I proposed a secure, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot that would allow clients to query their data through a private, conversational interface—without storing sensitive prompts or producing risk-prone artifacts. Beyond interpreting results, this tool would help clients make informed decisions about how best to engage with Oritain’s service: when and where to test, how frequently, and how to evolve testing strategies over time.

While this concept remained exploratory, it was deeply grounded in themes that emerged throughout MVP research and prototyping. It represented a clear path toward premium capabilities and product differentiation—and positioned Oritain to stay ahead of evolving user expectations.

## Outcomes & Impact
---

- Launched the client platform with no disruption to contract obligations
- Streamlined result delivery from a turnaround time of days to seconds
- Earned strong feedback from clients, internal teams, and the board
- Clients described the portal as a model for their own internal tools
- Scaled UX efforts across client, internal, and vendor-facing use cases
- Developed a unified design system across product and marketing
- Delivered features that improved usability, accelerated adoption, and unlocked revenue opportunities
- Hired and mentored a second UX designer to meet increased product demand
- Positioned the company for AI-enabled premium service offerings
- Reshaped how clients and suppliers interacted with Oritain—bringing clarity, transparency, and professionalism to the forefront
- One major client asked to contact the team behind the platform due to exceptional supplier feedback

## Client feedback:
---

“Suppliers report the portal being easy to navigate, with timely guidance and efficient troubleshooting. We are very pleased with this demonstration of commitment to the customer experience… \[Redacted Client\] has high standards, and we appreciate your partnership in easing the supplier compliance burden.”

## Reflection
---

I secured budget and defined a new UX role focused on improving internal service delivery tools. However, I ultimately paused hiring after recognizing that the product organization in New Zealand was not yet mature enough to support the role effectively. I’ve since learned that placing a designer into an undefined product environment—especially in a tight hiring market—can create more risk than reward.

In hindsight, earlier UX involvement in internal tooling could have accelerated operational gains. But deferring the hire until the right foundations were in place helped protect team health and long-term outcomes.

This experience reaffirmed the value of embedding design deeply in strategic delivery—and it’s shaped how I approach leading teams that balance ambition with operational reality.
