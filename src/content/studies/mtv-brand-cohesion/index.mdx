## Overview
---

When I joined MTV, the company had recognized a core challenge: our ever-evolving design language had become less effective in a rapidly expanding, multi-channel media environment. Competing networks were building distinctive brand systems, while MTV’s aesthetic—varied by design—was losing visual coherence and impact.

The marketing design team had begun exploring a rebrand. At that point, MTV’s digital platforms remained disconnected from the evolving strategy.

My first move was to collaborate closely with the head of marketing design, ensuring digital had a voice in brand development. Simultaneously, I assessed MTV’s digital platforms and began laying the foundation for realignment. Once the new brand direction was established, I led the translation of brand principles into UI visual and interaction systems—creating a consistent presence across MTV’s website, apps, and consoles.

## Translating and Aligning Brand Strategy Across Teams
---

MTV’s visual identity had long embraced change and experimentation. But as new channels emerged with focused brand strategies, MTV’s fluid aesthetic diluted its recognizability.

Marketing responded by embracing a Swiss-inspired rebrand: bold typography, content-forward layouts, grid-based design, and minimalist color use. As the sole digital representative during this transformation, I translated these principles into scalable design systems for interactive platforms.

**My Role:**

- Acted as a bridge between marketing and digital design  
- Created reusable digital design components aligned to the brand system  
- Introduced design heuristics to guide the team: *Be bold. Use color to guide the eye. Let content lead. Embrace white space. Just enough is more.*

**Culturally, I also worked to dissolve silos:**

- Built strong relationships across teams and encouraged real-time collaboration  
- Participated in marketing design reviews and campaign development  
- Embedded digital design leads into all major brand campaigns (e.g., award shows, premieres)

These efforts normalized cross-platform collaboration and unified MTV’s design execution across print, TV, and digital.

## Realigning MTV’s Digital Ecosystem

MTV’s website had grown chaotic—visual styles shifted between pages, undermining navigation and brand perception.

To address this:

- I initiated a full digital audit and secured cross-functional support  
- We evaluated content by traffic and brand value  
- We removed outdated or low-value properties and streamlined site architecture  
- We rolled out standardized brand-aligned themes—both universal and show-specific

This effort removed years of visual and structural inconsistency and laid the groundwork for a responsive redesign.

## Elevating Typography Across Viacom
---

To reflect MTV's new brand system online, we needed high-quality typography. Helvetica, the brand’s primary typeface, wasn’t consistently available on web platforms in 2010.

I spearheaded this effort by:

- Identifying typography as a core element of the rebrand’s digital translation  
- Negotiating licensing terms with Typekit (now Adobe Fonts), navigating a months-long legal process with Viacom’s internal teams  
- Leading adoption and rollout of Typekit across all Viacom digital properties  
- Securing direct type foundry licenses when necessary to ensure fidelity

This elevated MTV’s digital design and set a new visual standard across Viacom.

## Impact
---

- Users in research studies began recognizing MTV content through visual design alone—proof that brand recognition had taken hold.  
- Cross-platform collaboration between digital and marketing became normalized and embedded in workflows.  
- The digital visual design team was reorganized into the marketing group after my departure, reflecting the success of the integration.  
- Typekit became a standard design tool across Viacom, paving the way for more advanced, scalable design systems.  
- MTV.com and apps were fully aligned with the rebrand, creating a unified, high-impact digital identity.

## Reflection
---

This experience reshaped how I approach brand design within digital organizations. I learned that:

- Translating brand strategy into UX and UI systems requires early engagement and organizational trust  
- Cultural alignment is essential for meaningful design transformation  
- Design systems are the link between visual identity, interaction consistency, and long-term scalability  

By embedding digital design into the branding process from the outset, I helped transform MTV’s fragmented experiences into a cohesive, recognizable ecosystem.
